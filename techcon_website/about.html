            <p>
            TechCon began in 2010 as a small gathering of technology enthusiasts eager to share ideas and innovations. The inaugural event, held in a local community center, attracted just over 100 participants but set the stage for what would become a premier technology conference.

            Over the years, TechCon has grown exponentially, welcoming industry leaders, startups, and students from around the world. By 2015, the conference expanded to include hands-on workshops, keynote speeches from renowned technologists, and interactive exhibitions.
